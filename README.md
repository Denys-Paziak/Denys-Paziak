# Hi 👋, I'm Denis

## 🚀 About Me
I am always interested in learning new technologies
and improving my skills. My goal is to
to develop innovative solutions that will help
solve complex problems in an efficient way.

I'm currently learning how to use Next JS, and I'm
confident that I will be able to use this technology
in my future projects. I am always ready to
to expand my knowledge and experience in using
Redux and other technologies to achieve better
results in my work.
